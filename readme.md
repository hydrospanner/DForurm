# DForum

A simple Forum for Django apps.

I was thinking of Reddit's functionalty when building this app. The forum index page features a recent posts page from all 
forums. Each post links to a user's page listing their activity. 

Users can:   
* add a forum
* post a topic
* post a reply

The forum functionality is kept in the forum directory, while general website functions like user sign/signup and the base layout 
are in the app directory.
